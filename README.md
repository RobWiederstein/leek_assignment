HAR Data Set Assignment
=======================

This project deals with human activity recognition ("HAR"). The data set
is available from the [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
There are 10,299 observations in the data set.

While wearing a smartphone, thirty volunteers participated in six
activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting,
standing, standing, and laying. The subjects were divided into two sets
with 21 assigned to the training set and 9 to the test set.

The assignment essentially required for the data to be recombined in one
tidy dataframe and computations to be completed. Since no computations
were required of the "Inertial Signals" folder, it was disregarded.
